  #### Python Interpreter(I use 3.8.10)
  #### Ursina Engine(just do $pip install ursina)
  #### Perlin_Noise($pip install perlin_noise)
## Instructions:
  #### Just open the .py file and make sure you have these extensions installed. Enjoy!
## Controls:
  ### Moving
  #### Mouse to aim
  #### WASD to move
  #### Left click and aim at a block to place the block in your hand.
  #### Right click and aim to destroy a block
  #### Double press P to exit fullscreen or press once to enable off center mouse
  #### ESC to quit
  #### R to respawn back to spawn point(Blocks will not be reset)
  #### F5 to restart the game to its original state

Try the game and please let me know what you think and report any bugs found in the game.
